# Kotlin Travel App

## Introduction

This project was developed as part of the "Master's Degree in Software Engineering: Cloud, Data, and Information Technology Management" program. The app was built using Kotlin programming language and was designed to provide users with an easy and convenient way to search for trips. 

## Learning Kotlin

This was my first experience using Kotlin, and I learned a lot in the process. Some of the things I learned include:
- The basics on how android and Kotlin apps work.
- Kotlin's null safety feature, which helped me avoid null pointer exceptions.
- Data classes, which made it easy to create classes that hold data and have some built-in functionalities, such as `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`.
- Lambda expressions, which allowed me to write more concise and expressive code.

## App Features

The app's home page consists of a list of trips that users can search by origin and destination. Users can apply filters such as date range and price range, toggle a column view, and show only bookmarks.

Users can click on a trip to open a detailed view, which displays more information about the trip, such as the trip's departure and return dates, price, description... Users can also bookmark and purchase the trip from the detailed view.

## Future Development

This app is just the beginning of what I plan to build. In the future, I plan to continue the development of the app as an iOS app in Swift. I also plan to integrate Firebase to provide real-time data synchronization, user authentication, cloud storage, firestore, analytics, notifications...

## Conclusion

Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to learn Kotlin and build a functional app. I am excited about the future development of the app and the new features that I plan to add. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to contact me.
